    "If you work in the data business, you'll eventually find yourself trying to make an approximate match from one data source to another.  This comes in at least three flavors: _searching_, where a user-supplied name is matched against a database (for example, auto-complete); _joining_ or [_record linkage_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage), where you're trying to join datasets like you would with a relational join except based on an approximate criteria; and _deduplication_ or _clustering_, where you're trying to group items from one source based on similarity.  The general problem of trying to determine if two records refer to the same entity is called _entity resolution_.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks are sometimes performed with a SQL database or some other information retrieval system (eg, Solr). But there are situations where we need something slightly different than the normal database management system, or we just want something simpler that doesn't require a separate deployment."

    "The first step in matching is to identify fields that can be used to link sources.  These are usually elements of the identity of the item, such as name, address or SSN.  However, they can be other properties that change with time such as age, assets in an account, or number of children.  Beyond merely locating such identifiers we also need to see if they are used consistently.  If a field is often left blank it might not be useful for linking source, or if it was originally entered by hand it might have mistakes in value or format.  This type of analysis is an aspect of what's sometimes called _data profiling_."

That's not huge by today's standards, but you can see that the larger our data sets get, the more we want to eliminate record pairs. Below is shown a traditional method for blocking, where records in the two data sets are candidates if they have the same soundex value. Soundex is a code that's supposed to indicate strings that begin with similar sounds."

    "We now have numerous tools to match approximately on attributes, so we'll return to the problem of matching items in one set of data to another set.  Remember that in principle we have to check every single pair in the set A x B, which for our test data is about 900M pairs.  Although that's not a huge problem by today's standards, it's still significant and we know that most pairs are not matches, so we seek some way to reduce the number of pairs to test.  Usually this is accomplished by some sort of _indexing_, or in the language of entity resolution _blocking_.  We will discuss blocking later, but usually it involves clustering the candidate items in some way so that each item in set A only needs to be checked against a corresponding cluster in set B.\n",

There are two things we can learn from this: one is that we will miss some matches if we rely on exact matches, and the other is that you will rarely find a threshold for any approximate match such that everything is a match.  One of the key problems in matching is finding the most true matches while introducing the least false positives.\n",

We could say that anything > 2.9 is a match, anything < 2.0 is a non-match, and everything between 2.9 and 2.0 is uncertain (ie, might need a human to look at it).\n",

It was motivated by a need to link records from various data sources collected by the Census Bureau.  Like the heuristic method above, the goals here is to find two threshold levels, T_u and T_l, such that anything above T_u is a positive link, anything below T_l is a positive non_link, and anything between is uncertain.  However, the goal with this method is to be able to set the threshold values such that they meet known (and presumably acceptable) error rates.\n",
